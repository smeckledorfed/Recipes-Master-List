# Recipe Websites Master List
- Every website is in 1-4 different sections. Some websites focus on more than one thing (ex. if it's Italian, vegan, & gluten-free, it will be listed in each of those sections). 
- Websites in a particular category do not ONLY offer recipes of that kind; that German website might have some delicious keto stuff. I don't know, I haven't looked through them all, but you can. Life is all about exploration. 
- If a website doesn't seem to have a particular focus on anything, it will be in the *Miscellaneous* section.
- When it comes to which category a website is placed in, I usually go by how the About section identifies it.
- Brands have been **bolded**.
